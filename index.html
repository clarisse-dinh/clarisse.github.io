  <h2> Empower your mind and body, but most of all: realise your <i> soul </i></h2>
  <h3> <u><b> The Bhagavad Gita </b> </u></h3>
  <h3> 2 main ways to interpret the Bhagavad Gita: </h3>
  <ol>
    <li> A text to help you build a relationship with the divine </li>
    <li> A guide containing general advice on how to lead your life with a sense of unwavering calm (a form of ancient stoic wisdom) </li>
  </ol>

  <h3> My Favourite Verses: </h3>
  <ul>

  <li> Weapons do not cut this Spirit, fire does not burn it, water does not make it wet, and the wind does not make it dry. </li>
  <li> One who is able to withdraw the senses from their objects, just as a tortoise withdraws its limbs into its shell, is established in divine wisdom </li>
  <li> Fight and you will conquer the enemies of your mind... </li>
  <li>You have the right to work, but for the work's sake only.
    You have no right to the fruits of work. Desire for the fruits of work must never be your motive in working. Never give way to laziness, either.</li>
  </li>
  </ul>
